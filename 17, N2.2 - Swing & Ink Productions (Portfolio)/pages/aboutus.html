                <h1> About Swing & Ink Productions! </h1>    
    
                <p> At Swing & Ink Productions, we are storytellers, dream-weavers, and crafters of nostalgia-infused magic. Born from a love of hand-drawn animation and the irresistible charm of vintage jazz,
                    our studio dances on the line between past and present, creating games that pulse with life, rhythm, and challenge. </p>
                
                <p> Our story began in the year 2000, with nothing but a shared dream and a relentless passion for animation and gaming.
                    Through years of dedication, obstacles, and unwavering belief in our vision, we transformed sketches into stories, ideas into adventures, and challenges into triumphs.
                    Today, our flagship title, Capuhead, stands as a testament to that journey-each frame meticulously illustrated, each note of the soundtrack a toe-tapping tribute to the golden age of swing. </p>
                
                <p> We believe that games are a canvas, and with every pixel, we paint a journey filled with wonder, perseverance, and the joy of discovery.
                    Step into our world, where ink flows like imagination and every adventure is a celebration of creativity.
                    Swing with us into a realm of endless possibility, where the spirit of classic cartoons meets the thrill of modern gameplay. </p>
                
                <h3> Welcome to Swing & Ink Productions - Where games are art, and every story is a masterpiece. </h3>
